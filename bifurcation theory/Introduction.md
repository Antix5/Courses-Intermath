# Dynamical systems and bifurcation theory

## Main parts : 

- Part 1 :
  - Linear systems
  - Local theory

- Part 2 :
  - Global theory
  - Bifurcation theory

Outline of the course :

1. Uncoupled **linear** systems and diagonalisation

Basic concepts :
$\dot{x}=Ax$
$A = diag(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ study of the qualitative behaviour of trajectories

2. Matrix **exponential** and fundamental theory of linear systems

$e^{At} \sim \dot{x} = Ax$

3. Linear systems in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) description of phase portraits

4. Linear systems in \(\mathbb{R}^n\):

Complexe number and multiple eigenvalues

5. Stability in linear systems

Stable and unstable subspaces, invariable hyperbolicity

6. Non-homogeneous linear systems (variation of constant formula)

7. **Non-linear** systems :
   $\dot{x} = f(x)$
  $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$

  basic results about existence and uniqueness of solutions

8. The flow generated by $\dot{x} = f(x)$, definition and rescaling on $\mathbb{R}$

9. Linearisation of non-linear systems

$\dot{x} = f(x) \rightarrow \dot{x} = Ax$
$A = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0)$

10. Stability and Lyapunov functions

11. Planar systems $\dot{x} = f(x), x \in \mathbb{R}^n$

12. Normal forms, Gradient and Hamiltonian systems, Newtonnian systems
